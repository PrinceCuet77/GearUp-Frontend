# GearUp Auth API — Integration Spec (v1)

Authentication API reference for the GearUp backend, covering **email/password (credentials) login** and **Google OAuth 2.0 login**, written for a Next.js frontend integration.

- **Base path:** `/api/v1/auth`
- **Full base URL:** `<API_BASE_URL>/api/v1/auth` (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth`)
- **Content type:** `application/json`
- **Auth scheme:** JWT — sent either as an `accessToken` cookie or an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

> A legacy credentials-only version of these endpoints still exists at `/api/auth` (no Google support). **Use `/api/v1/auth` for all new integration work.**

## 1. Response conventions

### Success envelope

Every successful response uses the same shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "data": { }
}
```

`meta` (`{ page, limit, total, totalPages }`) is only present on paginated list endpoints — never on auth endpoints.

### Error envelope

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Invalid refresh token",
  "errorDetails": "Error: Invalid refresh token\n    at ...stack trace..."
}
```

- `message` is the only field safe to show to a user.
- `errorDetails` is a raw stack trace. **Do not render it in the UI.**
- Validation failures return one flattened string of all issues, e.g.
  `"email: Invalid email format, password: Password must be at least 6 characters"`.

### Detecting success on the client

Check the HTTP status code **and** the `success` flag. Do not rely on `statusCode` in the body alone.

---

## 2. Tokens & cookies

On successful credential login and Google login, the API sets two `Set-Cookie` headers:

| Cookie | Contains | Lifetime | Flags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accessToken` | Short-lived JWT used to authorise API calls | 24 hours (`maxAge: 86400000`) | `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=None`, `Secure`, `Path=/` |
| `refreshToken` | Long-lived JWT used to mint a new access token | 7 days (`maxAge: 604800000`) | `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=None`, `Secure`, `Path=/` |

The flags are derived from the deployment: when `APP_URL` and `API_URL` resolve to **different hostnames** the cookies are cross-site and are issued `SameSite=None; Secure`. When they share a hostname (local dev, or the API proxied through the Next.js app) they are issued `SameSite=Lax` without `Secure`, so plain-HTTP dev keeps working.

Both cookies are **HttpOnly** — browser JavaScript cannot read them. They are attached automatically by the browser only when the request is made with credentials enabled (`fetch(..., { credentials: 'include' })` or `axios` with `withCredentials: true`).

### JWT payload

Both tokens are signed with `HS256` and carry the same claims:

```json
{
  "userId": "0b0f2c2f-6f5b-4b0e-9c4f-1c9c1a2c3d4e",
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "role": "CUSTOMER",
  "iat": 1760000000,
  "exp": 1760086400
}
```

Access and refresh tokens are signed with **different secrets**; expiry windows come from backend env vars (`JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN`, `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN`) and may differ from the cookie `maxAge` values above. Treat the JWT `exp` claim as the source of truth for token validity.

> ⚠️ **Third-party cookie caveat.** `SameSite=None; Secure` is the *most* a cross-domain deployment can do, but it does not make the cookies universally reliable. `gear-up-frontend-green.vercel.app` and `gear-up-self.vercel.app` are separate **sites** (`vercel.app` is on the Public Suffix List, so no shared cookie `Domain` is possible), which makes the API's cookies third-party from the frontend's point of view. Chrome sends them by default; **Safari, Firefox, and Chrome incognito block them outright.**
>
> Two supported ways out, in order of preference:
> 1. **Same-origin proxy** — route the API through the Next.js app so the cookies become first-party. See [§7.2](#72-recommended-setup-same-origin-proxy). This is the durable fix.
> 2. **Adopt the tokens the OAuth callback hands back** in the redirect's URL fragment (see [§3.4](#34-get-apiv1authgooglecallback)) and store them as a first-party cookie set by your own Next.js origin. Credential login already returns both tokens in the JSON body for the same purpose.

---

## 3. Endpoint reference

### 3.1 `POST /api/v1/auth/register`

Creates a new credentials-based account. Does **not** log the user in — no cookies are set and no tokens are returned. Call `POST /login` afterwards.

**Auth:** none.

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | yes | Valid email format. Must be unique. |
| `password` | string | yes | 6–20 characters. |
| `role` | `"CUSTOMER" \| "PROVIDER" \| "ADMIN"` | **yes in practice** | Marked optional by the request validator, but the database column has no default — omitting it fails with a 400. Always send it. |

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "secret123",
  "role": "CUSTOMER"
}
```

**`201 Created`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 201,
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "0b0f2c2f-6f5b-4b0e-9c4f-1c9c1a2c3d4e",
      "name": null,
      "email": "customer@example.com",
      "role": "CUSTOMER",
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "avatarUrl": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-08-12T10:15:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-08-12T10:15:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The password hash is stripped from this response.

**Errors**

| Status | `message` | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `"email: Invalid email format"` (comma-joined list) | Zod validation failed |
| `400` | `"You have provided incorrect field type or missing fields"` | `role` was omitted |
| `409` | `"A user with this email already exists!"` | Email already registered (including via Google) |

> A user who first signed up with Google has an account row with `password: null`. Registering the same email again returns `409`, not an account merge. Direct such users to “Continue with Google”.

---

### 3.2 `POST /api/v1/auth/login`

Email + password login. Authenticated by a Passport **local** strategy.

**Auth:** none.

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | yes | Valid email format |
| `password` | string | yes | Min length 1 |

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

**`200 OK`** — also sets the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "0b0f2c2f-6f5b-4b0e-9c4f-1c9c1a2c3d4e",
      "userId": "0b0f2c2f-6f5b-4b0e-9c4f-1c9c1a2c3d4e",
      "name": "Rezoan",
      "email": "customer@example.com",
      "password": "$2a$10$......",
      "role": "CUSTOMER",
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "avatarUrl": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-08-12T10:15:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-08-12T10:15:00.000Z"
    },
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
    "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
  }
}
```

Notes on this payload:

- `id` and `userId` are the same value (`userId` is added by the Passport strategy). Prefer `id`.
- ⚠️ **`user.password` currently contains the bcrypt hash.** This is a backend bug (see [§9](#9-known-issues--questions-for-the-backend-team)). Never store it, log it, or put it in client-side state — strip it on receipt and expect it to disappear once fixed.
- `accessToken` / `refreshToken` are returned in the body **in addition to** the cookies, so a Bearer-token integration is possible without relying on cookies.

**Errors**

| Status | `message` | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `"email: Invalid email format"` etc. | Zod validation failed |
| `403` | `"Your account has been suspended. Please contact support."` | `status === SUSPENDED` |
| `500` | `"User not found with this email, Please register first!"` | Unknown email |
| `500` | `"Password does not matched"` | Wrong password |
| `500` | `"This account does not have password, Please login with google"` | Google-only account (`password: null`) |

> ⚠️ **Authentication failures currently return HTTP `500`, not `401`.** Passport failures are forwarded as plain `Error` objects, which the global error handler cannot classify. **Do not branch on the status code for login failures** — read `message` instead, or treat any non-2xx from this endpoint as “login failed”. This is expected to change to `401` once fixed; write your handler so it tolerates both.

---

### 3.3 `GET /api/v1/auth/google` · `/google/customer` · `/google/provider`

Starts the Google OAuth 2.0 flow. Responds with a `302` redirect to Google's consent screen (`scope: profile email`).

**Auth:** none. **Request body:** none.

| Variant | Role given to a **brand-new** account |
| --- | --- |
| `/google` | `CUSTOMER` (kept for backwards compatibility) |
| `/google/customer` | `CUSTOMER` |
| `/google/provider` | `PROVIDER` |

There is no `/google/admin`, and the role only applies to accounts being created — an existing user's role is never changed by signing in with Google.

| Query param | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `redirect` | No | Frontend path to return to. **Must start with `/`** (a `400` otherwise — absolute and protocol-relative URLs are rejected to prevent an open redirect). Defaults to the role's dashboard (`/customer`, `/provider`, `/admin`). |

This is a **browser navigation endpoint, not an AJAX endpoint.** It must be reached by a full page navigation:

```tsx
<a href={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/v1/auth/google/provider?redirect=/oauth/callback`}>
  Continue with Google
</a>
```

Calling it with `fetch`/`axios` will fail (CORS blocks the cross-origin redirect to Google).

The endpoint packs the role, the `redirect` path, and the origin the navigation came from into an HMAC-signed, 10-minute `state` param that Google returns to the callback. Nothing needs to be stashed in `localStorage` across the redirect.

---

### 3.4 `GET /api/v1/auth/google/callback`

The redirect URI that Google calls back with `?code=...`. **The frontend never calls this directly.** It must exactly match the `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` configured in both the backend `.env` and the Google Cloud Console OAuth client.

It first validates the signed `state`; a missing, tampered, or >10-minute-old state is rejected **without** exchanging the code. On success the endpoint:

1. Finds the user by the Google-provided email, or creates one (`name` = Google display name, `avatarUrl` = Google photo, `role` = the role from `state`).
2. If the user already exists as a credentials account, links a `GOOGLE` auth record to it — same account, same `id`. Email/password login keeps working.
3. Sets the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies (same flags as §2).
4. Issues `302 Found` to the frontend.

**Success redirect**

```
<origin><redirect>?role=<ROLE>&isNewUser=<true|false>#accessToken=<jwt>&refreshToken=<jwt>
```

- `<origin>` is the frontend origin the flow started on (taken from the signed `state`, and re-checked against the CORS allowlist), falling back to `APP_URL`.
- `<redirect>` is the path requested at §3.3, defaulting to the role's dashboard.
- The **fragment** carries the tokens. A fragment is never sent to a server, so unlike query params it stays out of access logs and `Referer` headers. Read it only if you need the third-party-cookie fallback from §2; strip it from the URL (`history.replaceState`) once consumed. Frontends relying on the cookies can ignore it entirely.

**Failure redirect** — `302` to `<origin><redirect>?error=<code>` (defaulting to `/login`). It no longer renders a JSON error page.

| `error` code | Cause | Suggested copy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_oauth_state` | State missing, tampered, or older than 10 minutes | "Your sign-in link expired. Please try again." |
| `google_authentication_failed` | Google rejected the exchange, or the user cancelled | "Google sign-in was cancelled or failed." |
| `No email found from google!` | The Google account exposed no email address | Show as-is |
| `Your account has been suspended. Please contact support.` | Account is `SUSPENDED` | Show as-is |

---

### 3.5 `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`

Exchanges the refresh-token cookie for a fresh access token.

**Auth:** requires the `refreshToken` **cookie**. The token is read from cookies only — a request body or `Authorization` header is ignored. Send with credentials enabled.

**Request body:** none.

**`200 OK`** — also sets a new `accessToken` cookie.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Token Refreshed Successfully",
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
  }
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | `message` | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `"refreshToken: Refresh token is required"` | Cookie missing / not forwarded |
| `401` | `"jwt expired"` / `"invalid signature"` / `"Invalid refresh token"` | Refresh token expired or invalid — force a re-login |

> The refresh token is **not rotated** — the same refresh cookie stays valid for its full 7 days. There is no server-side revocation, so `POST /logout` only clears the browser's cookies; a copied token remains valid until it expires.

---

### 3.6 `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`

Clears the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies.

**Auth:** none required (always succeeds). **Request body:** none.

**`200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "User logged out successfully",
  "data": null
}
```

Must be called with credentials enabled for the cookie clearing to reach the browser. If you also keep tokens in client state, clear them yourself.

      | -----------------------------> |                             |
```

**Frontend responsibilities**

1. Render a plain link/anchor (or `window.location.href = ...`) to `GET /api/v1/auth/google`. Never `fetch` it.
2. Build a page at `/customer` that runs on load: call `GET /api/user/me` with credentials to fetch the signed-in user, then route by `role` (a `PROVIDER` or `ADMIN` who signs in with Google also lands on `/customer` — redirect them from there).
3. Handle the "already there" case — if `/api/user/me` returns `401`, the cookie did not survive the redirect (see the cross-site cookie caveat in §2) and the user should be shown the login page again.

---

## 5. Data models

### User

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string (uuid) | Primary key |
| `name` | string \| null | `null` for credentials sign-ups; Google display name for Google sign-ups |
| `email` | string | Unique |
| `password` | string \| null | bcrypt hash; `null` for Google-only accounts. Should never reach the client (see §9) |
| `role` | `CUSTOMER` \| `PROVIDER` \| `ADMIN` | |
| `status` | `ACTIVE` \| `SUSPENDED` | `SUSPENDED` blocks login and every authenticated request |
| `avatarUrl` | string \| null | Not populated from the Google profile today |
| `createdAt` | ISO 8601 string | |
| `updatedAt` | ISO 8601 string | |

### Auth (linked identities — not exposed by any auth endpoint)

One row per sign-in method attached to a user: `provider` is `CREDENTIALS` or `GOOGLE`. A single user can hold both, which is how account linking works when a credentials user later signs in with Google.

### Suggested TypeScript types

```ts
export type UserRole = 'CUSTOMER' | 'PROVIDER' | 'ADMIN';
export type UserStatus = 'ACTIVE' | 'SUSPENDED';

export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string | null;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  status: UserStatus;
  avatarUrl: string | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

export interface ApiSuccess<T> {
  success: true;
  statusCode: number;
  message: string;
  data: T;
  meta?: { page: number; limit: number; total: number; totalPages: number };
}

export interface ApiError {
  success: false;
  statusCode: number;
  message: string;
  errorDetails?: string;
}

export type LoginData = {
  user: User & { userId: string };
  accessToken: string;
  refreshToken: string;
};
```

---

## 6. Using the token on protected endpoints

Protected routes accept the access token in **either** form; the cookie is checked first:

```http
Cookie: accessToken=<jwt>
```

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

On every protected request the API re-reads the user from the database and rejects suspended accounts, so a valid token alone is not enough.

**Common auth errors on protected endpoints**

| Status | `message` |
| --- | --- |
| `401` | `"You are not logged in. Please log in to access this resource."` |
| `401` | `"jwt expired"` — call `POST /refresh`, then retry once |
| `403` | `"Forbidden. You don't have permission to access this resource."` (role mismatch) |
| `403` | `"Your account has been blocked. Please contact support."` |
| `404` | `"User not found. Please log in again."` |

Useful endpoint for session hydration: **`GET /api/user/me`** (any authenticated role).

## 7. Next.js integration guide

### 7.1 Environment

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

The backend must have `APP_URL` set to your Next.js origin (it is the fallback for CORS and the post-Google redirect), `API_URL` set to its own public origin (it decides the cookie flags), and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` set to `<API_URL>/api/v1/auth/google/callback`. Extra allowed frontend origins go in `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated).

> **These are read from the hosting provider's environment, not from a committed `.env`.** `.env` is gitignored and never deployed, so editing it locally has no effect on a deployed backend — the values must be updated in the Vercel project settings (and the project redeployed, since env vars are baked in at build/boot).

### 7.2 Recommended setup: same-origin proxy

Because the API's cookies are third-party on a split-domain deployment, the most reliable setup is to proxy the API through your Next.js origin so they become first-party:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/backend/:path*',
        destination: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/:path*`,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

Then call `/api/backend/v1/auth/login` etc. from the browser. If you use the proxy, point the Google link at `/api/backend/v1/auth/google` as well, and make sure the backend's `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` still points at the real API host.

Without the proxy, use the Bearer-token path described in §7.5.

### 7.3 Client-side fetch helper

```ts
const API = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL!;

async function apiFetch<T>(path: string, init: RequestInit = {}): Promise<T> {
  const res = await fetch(`${API}${path}`, {
    ...init,
    credentials: 'include', // required — cookies are HttpOnly
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', ...(init.headers ?? {}) },
  });

  const body = await res.json().catch(() => null);

  if (!res.ok || !body?.success) {
    throw new Error(body?.message ?? 'Request failed');
  }
  return body.data as T;
}
```

### 7.4 Credential login

```ts
export async function login(email: string, password: string) {
  const data = await apiFetch<LoginData>('/api/v1/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),
  });

  // Strip the hash the API currently leaks before touching app state.
  const { password: _drop, userId: _dup, ...user } = data.user as any;
  return { user: user as User, accessToken: data.accessToken };
}
```

Remember: any non-2xx here means "login failed" — including the current `500`s. Surface `error.message` directly; the backend messages are already user-readable.

### 7.5 Alternative: Bearer tokens (no cookies)

If cross-site cookies are blocked in your deployment, credential login still works — take `accessToken` from the JSON body, keep it in memory (plus `refreshToken` in storage if you must), and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**This does not cover Google login**, which delivers its session only via cookies. Google sign-in therefore requires either the same-origin proxy from §7.2 or the backend fix in §9.

### 7.6 Server Components / Route Handlers

Forward the incoming cookies when calling the API from the server:

```ts
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

export async function getMe() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/user/me`, {
    headers: { Cookie: cookieStore.toString() },
    cache: 'no-store',
  });
  if (!res.ok) return null;
  return (await res.json()).data;
}
```

Note that `Set-Cookie` headers returned by the API in a Server Component are **not** forwarded to the browser automatically — perform login and refresh from the browser, or from a Route Handler that re-emits the cookies.

### 7.7 Refresh-on-401 pattern

```ts
async function withRefresh<T>(call: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  try {
    return await call();
  } catch (err) {
    await fetch(`${API}/api/v1/auth/refresh`, {
      method: 'POST',
      credentials: 'include',
    }); // throws/fails -> redirect to /login
    return await call(); // retry once, never loop
  }
}
```

Refresh once per failed request at most. A failed refresh means the 7-day refresh token is gone — clear local state and send the user to the login page.

### 7.8 Middleware / route protection

`middleware.ts` can check for the presence of the `accessToken` cookie to gate routes, but it **cannot verify** it (the signing secret lives on the backend). Use it for coarse redirects only, and let the API be the real authority:

```ts
export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const hasSession = req.cookies.has('accessToken');
  if (!hasSession && req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/customer')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}
```

## 8. CORS & allowed origins

The API runs with `credentials: true` and an origin allowlist:

- the backend's `APP_URL` env value
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `https://gearup-rent.netlify.app`
- `https://gear-up-self.vercel.app`

Requests from any other origin are rejected by CORS. **If you deploy the Next.js app to a new domain, the backend allowlist must be updated first** — this is a code change in `src/app.ts`, not just an env var (unless the new domain is set as `APP_URL`).

## 9. Known issues / questions for the backend team

These are behaviours observed in the current implementation that affect integration. They are listed here so the client can code defensively and so the backend team can prioritise fixes.

| # | Issue | Impact on the frontend | Suggested fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Login failures return `500`** instead of `401`/`404`. Passport failures are wrapped in a plain `Error`. | Cannot branch on status code; must read `message`. | Throw `UnauthorizedError`/`NotFoundError` from the login controller. |
| 2 | **The bcrypt password hash is returned** in `POST /login` → `data.user.password`. | Security risk; must be stripped client-side. | Strip `password` (and the duplicate `userId`) before `sendResponse`. |
| 3 | ~~**Cookies use `SameSite=None` with `Secure=false`.**~~ **Fixed** — the flags are now derived from whether `APP_URL` and `API_URL` share a hostname (§2). The cookies remain *third-party* on a split-domain deployment, so the §2 caveat still applies. | — | — |
| 4 | **`errorDetails` returns a full stack trace** on every error, in every environment. | Must never be rendered. | Omit in production. |
| 5 | ~~**Google callback always redirects to `<APP_URL>/customer`**~~ **Fixed** — redirects by role, or to the `redirect` path the frontend asked for. | — | — |
| 6 | ~~**No role selection on Google sign-up**~~ **Fixed** — `/google/customer` and `/google/provider` carry the role through Google in a signed `state`. | — | — |
| 7 | ~~**Google callback errors return raw JSON in the browser**~~ **Fixed** — failures redirect to `?error=<code>` (§3.4). | — | — |
| 8 | **Refresh tokens are not rotated or revocable**; `POST /logout` only clears cookies. | A stolen refresh token stays valid for 7 days after logout. | Persist and invalidate refresh tokens server-side. |
| 9 | **`role` is optional in the register validator** but required by the database. | Omitting it yields a confusing generic `400`. | Make `role` required in the Zod schema, or default it to `CUSTOMER`. |
